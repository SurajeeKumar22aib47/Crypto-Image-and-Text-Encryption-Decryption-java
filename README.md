# Crypto – Text & Image Encryption/Decryption Tool

## 📌 Overview
**Crypto** is a Java-based GUI application developed using **NetBeans IDE** that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** both text and images.  
The project aims to make cryptographic operations simple and accessible through an easy-to-use interface.

## 🎯 Features
- **Home Page**: Simple dashboard to choose between Text or Image encryption/decryption.
- **Text Encryption**: Converts plain text into unreadable cipher text using a secure key.
- **Text Decryption**: Restores encrypted text back to its original form using the same key.
- **Image Encryption**: Encodes image byte data so that unauthorized users cannot view it.
- **Image Decryption**: Decodes the encrypted image back to its original form.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Java Swing for a smooth experience.

## 🚀 How It Works
### Text Encryption
1. User enters the text.
2. An encryption key is applied to convert it into cipher text.
3. Output is displayed or saved for later use.

### Text Decryption
1. User enters the encrypted text and key.
2. The decryption process restores it to plain text.

### Image Encryption
1. User selects an image file.
2. The image’s byte data is encrypted and saved as a new file.

### Image Decryption
1. User selects an encrypted image file and provides the key.
2. The original image is reconstructed.
